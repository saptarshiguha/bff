Saving several large objects totalling several hundreds of megabytes in a single
Rdata file is not efficient:

- not possible to load one object, all objects are loaded even if you don't need them
- =attach= also load the Rdata file, even though all might not be needed

Using this file format it is possible to :
- easily append objects to a dataset
- load multiple folders by loading the top level folder
- a type of attach i.e the objects are in the namespace, but only loaded using /promises/

* Defect 

When appending an already existing object, the previous one is deleted and the
new one is appended to the end of the file. This causes fragmentation and the
datasets need to tbe /packed/ or /defragmented/. This is something todo.
